In this study, an inflow-driven analysis of historical construction data of wind turbines in Canada and a stock flow driven analysis based on projections of Canadian future wind energy demand is employed. This method enables the creation of capacity models for Canadian onshore wind turbines from 1993 to 2050 and offshore wind turbines from 2020 to 2050. Based on the annual capacity inflow of wind energy and the relationship between each wind turbine's average capacity and the size and mass of its components, further calculations are made to determine the various material inputs required for wind turbine construction. Additionally, using the dynamic material flow model, the annual outflow of materials is determined, and different recycling scenarios for the outflow materials are hypothesized, ultimately determining the annual requirement for virgin material quality. Then calculate the overall environmental impact based on the energy consumption and carbon emissions during the production process of virgin material and recycled materials.

The result of this study includes the estimated demand for metal materials, bulk materials, and rare earth elements essential for wind turbine construction, derived under diverse future wind energy scenarios factoring in energy demand volumes, capacity factors, technological market share shifts, and replacement rates and maintenance losses. Furthermore, this study compares the achievable closed-loop recycling, open-loop high and middle-end recycling, and downcycling material quantities, as well as the potential reductions in GHG emissions and energy consumption in the wind system under different end-of-life material recycling scenarios.

By providing a holistic model of material demand and environmental impact throughout the Canadian wind energy development process, this project not only addresses critical research gaps but also lays the groundwork for future studies in renewable energy sectors. Its findings are expected to significantly influence policy-making and practical applications in the wind energy industry, contributing to broader environmental sustainability goals.# wind_dMFA
